MDN Web Docs aims to be accessible to everyone, regardless of technology or ability. On this page, we list what the current situation is and how you can tell us about accessibility problems.

## Current status

The MDN Web Docs team actively works to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21)), version 2.1, Level A and AA.


### Most recent conformance audit

MDN Web Docs was most recently evaluated for WCAG conformance in January 2022. At the time of evaluation, MDN Web Docs met 43 out of 50 Success Criteria on Level A and AA. 

### Known issues

Despite best efforts, there are some cases in which MDN Web Docs does not meet the accessibility guidelines: 

* once a user is in the code editor, it is not possible to tab outside of it
* in CSS demos, it is not possible to switch between examples with just a keyboard
